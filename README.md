#### Different requirements for different types of encryption and decryption algorithms
#### Each key is separated by a space like: 3 4

Caesar Cipher                      k1
Affine Cipher                   a  and  b
Vigener Cipher                     k1                                                         
RSA Cipher                  p  and  q  and  e
Base64                      NONE(dont need key)
Column shift Cipher                k1
Vernam Cipher                      k1
