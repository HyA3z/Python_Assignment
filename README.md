Encryption

Implemented various file encryption algorithms.
1)Caesar Cipher
2)Affine Cipher
3)Vigener Cipher
4)RSA Cipher
5)Base64
6)Column shift Cipher
7)Vernam Cipher

Currently 1-6 supports running in the tktinter interface

7 Currently only runs in the compiler

‘’‘c
Here is the format of the input

                       The key that you need to pass
Caesar Cipher                   k1
Affine Cipher                a  and  b
Vigener Cipher                  k1
RSA Cipher                 p  and  q  and  e
Base64                        NONE(dont need key)
Column shift Cipher             k1
Vernam Cipher                   k1
